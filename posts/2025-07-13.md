We wanted to give a status update on the progress towards a v13.5 release.  
Things are progressing a bit slower because it's summertime and people are taking vacations, spending time with their family, etc. 

What has been completed:

- Switch OS repo from TrueNAS Forked repo to upstream FreeBSD repo and address the fallout due to iX's customizations of the OS tree.
- Fix pool creation that relied on custom iX scrup
- Fix var memory issue at boot
- Update nginx
- Update ZFS
- Update Bootloader
- Fix bootloader incompatibility issue
- Fix Samba420 build issue with truenas build system


What still needs to be completed: 

- Update openvpn
- Update openssl
- Need to import Truenas' custom RC for samba
- Upstream Samba 420 is broken


While we wait for samba to be addressed upstream, we may start a parallel 14.x build to slowly figure out what that task will look like.
